# Making a Theme

Theming is designed to be as easy as possible, as such, by default, no theme is applied to Vue Simple Phone. As such is easy to create your own with just css!

To create your own theme, all you need to do is define the following classes with styles...

`.vue-simple-phone-label`, `.vue-simple-phone-container`
